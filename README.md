# OOP-Practice-Assignment
"Object-oriented programming offers a new way of thinking about problems-practice it until it becomes second nature.”

# 🐍 Python OOP Practice Assignments
A collection of **21 beginner-to-intermediate level assignments** to help you master the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using traditional Python. Each assignment is self-contained in its own folder with clear, commented code inside a `main.py` file.

## 📘 Overview
These assignments are structured to provide hands-on experience with the following key OOP principles:
- 🔹 Object creation & initialization  
- 🔹 Encapsulation using access modifiers  
- 🔹 Inheritance & method resolution order (MRO)  
- 🔹 Polymorphism via abstract classes and decorators  
- 🔹 Composition vs. aggregation  
- 🔹 Custom behaviour with decorators, callable, exceptions, and iterables
